# Roadmap

The ordering principle: **the biggest risk is not a missing feature — it is that
no agent has ever used this mid-task.** The customer is the coding agent that
just built a UI and needs to know whether it works. Every phase either closes
that loop or widens what the loop can reach. Real usage re-ranks everything
below it; that is why dogfooding comes first, not last.

Status marks: `[x]` done · `[ ]` planned. Items move between phases when usage
proves the ordering wrong.

## Phase 1 — into the loop

Make an agent actually use clickgraph while building something, and let the
friction rank the rest of this file.

- [x] `--json` emits a compact machine-readable verdict for `walk` and `diff`
      (the full graph stays in the graph file and `show --json`)
- [x] A Claude Code skill (`skill/SKILL.md`) that teaches an agent when to
      walk, when to diff, and how to read the verdict
- [x] CI on this repo: `scripts/verify.sh` runs on every push
- [x] First dogfooding pass found two false-positive classes the fixture could
      not: a control that opens a panel looks dead once that panel is open
      (which also settles the `aria-current` ambiguity), and a `<select>` can
      never be verified by clicking. Both fixed.
- [ ] Dogfood continuously: the next real UI feature built by an agent ends
      with a clickgraph diff; every friction point becomes a tracked issue

## Phase 2 — past the login screen

The tool is currently locked out of most real apps at the front door.
Deliberately split in two, because one half is much cheaper than the other:

- [x] Auth via session reuse: `--storage-state <path>` walks signed in, and
      `clickgraph login <url>` captures the session by opening a browser and
      waiting while a human signs in. A login screen on the entry page is
      detected, reported, and fails the run — a gated app used to walk its own
      login form and call it clean.
- [ ] Form input: selects first — a finite option set and no free text, and
      they are already being skipped as `needs-input`. Then text fields with
      config-provided values. Submission gets the same caution as the
      dangerous-pattern rules — a walker that types into real forms can do
      real damage.
- [ ] Keep walking new real apps; each one so far has found a false-positive
      class the fixture could not (see README).

## Phase 3 — a fast inner loop

- [ ] Per-edge replay scripts: `diff` currently re-explores everything.
      Replaying the baseline's known edges deterministically is the cheap
      inner loop; exploration becomes occasional, replay runs on every change.
- [ ] Navigate by shortest path through the graph instead of resetting to the
      base URL between actions — the current speed ceiling.

## Phase 4 — the pairing and the showpiece

- [ ] Seed the walk from an App Atlas route map instead of discovering blind,
      and report static-vs-dynamic disagreement as its own findings section.
      The static map is a hint, never ground truth — where map and walk
      disagree, the disagreement is the report.
- [ ] Graph visualization: a viewer over `graph.json`, as a separate optional
      package so the CLI stays headless. This serves adoption more than the
      agent customer — it is the demo, not the product.

## Phase 5 — the AI layer (deliberately last)

The deterministic core has to earn trust before an LLM judges anything.

- [ ] The healer/judge: same-state-redesigned vs. new-state vs. broken, with
      confidence surfaced rather than asserted.
- [ ] Mobile via an adapter (Maestro), once the graph format has settled.

## Cross-cutting

- [ ] Publish to npm once the CLI surface stabilizes (likely after Phase 2) —
      that is what actually locks the name.
- [x] Resolved: an active nav item without `aria-current` used to be
      indistinguishable from a dead control. The already-applied rule settles
      it without depending on the app's ARIA hygiene.
